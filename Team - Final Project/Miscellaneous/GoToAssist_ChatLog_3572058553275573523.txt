Hi Peter, thank you for choosing Shaw! This is James from our Vancouver office. How are you today?

Peter Haile(20:03:21)
Great, thanks how are you?\

James 7214(20:03:35)
I am doing good today, thank you for asking. Is your address 1415 KEITH RD W ?

Peter Haile(20:03:41)
Yes

James 7214(20:04:34)
We are sorry to tell you that our residential Internet subscriptions do not have static IPs. You can get a static IP though our business services.

Peter Haile(20:05:13)
Ah okay, with that being said, what are the chances that Shaw will reassign my IP over the next few months?

James 7214(20:06:01)
That's a good question. It doesn't seem to happen on a set schedule.

Peter Haile(20:06:52)
Okay. If it happens I'll just deal with it accordingly. Thanks for your time James 7214

James 7214(20:07:02)
It was not a problem at all. Have a great day.

Peter Haile(20:07:02)
Cheers

James 7214(20:07:06)
